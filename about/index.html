<p>In lieu of a page on Wikipedia...</p><p>Billiam Coronel was born in Los Angeles..blah, blah, blah..moved to New York and became a stand-up..stuff..Improv, Comedy Cellar..work, travel..moved back to LA..became TV writer then film writer..Died March, 2061 of multiple blows to the head during an orgy at The Claremont Senior Center.</p><p> STAND UP YEARS </p><p> Billiam performed stand-up at clubs and colleges in the U.S., Canada, England, Mexico and between islands in The Caribbean during the 1980s. He’s performed in Vegas, Atlantic City, and headlined The Queens Theatre on London’s West End. He was a yearly staple at the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal and his material is entered in the Smithsonian Institute as examples of American humor during the 1980s. Don’t believe that? Take a LOOK. Billiam’s countless television appearances (Okay, not countless but many, many) include 2 Tonight Shows with Johnny Carson and, in no particular order, HBO, Showtime, Reno 911, and all those cable shows including Evening at the Improv,Caroline’s Comedy Hour, The A list, MTV's Half Hour Comedy Hour... All of 'em. He has opened shows for music acts including Reba McEntire, Warren Zevon, Buddy Rich and Joan Jett and has shared billing with comedians Bill Hicks, Dennis Miller, Chris Rock, Ray Romano, Jeff Dunham, Denis Leary, Jerry Seinfeld, Jeff Foxworthy and Sam Kinison. </p><p> TELEVISION WRITING</p><p>In the early 90s Billiam gave up performing for the opportunity to sit in a writer’s room all day and get fat. The change worked perfectly. Billiam has been nominated for 3 Emmys but won only twice. (Curse you, ) He has been on the writing staffs of Comic Strip Live, Platypus Man, The Parent ‘Hood, Men Behaving Badly, and was a producer/writer on The Tony Danza Show, Brother’s Keeper, Family Guy, The Immigrants (Exec. Producer / Show-runner), Teacher’s Pet and has written for the 79th Annual Academy Awards. </p><p> MOVIE AND OTHER STUFF </p><p>Currently a movie Billiam co-wrote, RIPPED VAN WINKLES, is in production starring Russell Peters. Yeah, THAT Russell Peters. Billiam's first movie, The High Roller, was bought by MGM which was subsequently bought by Sony and then thrown away. His third, Why Do Moths Fly Into Light Bulbs?was optioned by Steve Carell’s production company. Michael Keaton became attached, a rewrite was done, everybody liked it and then things went away. So he's 1 for 3 so far. Welcome to show biz. Billiam was also seen on Reno 911 and Louie CK's Louie. No autographs please. </p><p>ANIMAL INTERNET Billiam developed Animal Internet, the world’s first online community “run by and for animals.” It was My Space for your pets and imaginary animals that lived in your head. Like My Space, it died. The difference is My Space made some money. You can check out some of the animatorials (editorials written by animals) here . </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="29"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="31"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="32"><span data-reactid="33"><!-- react-empty: 34 --><h2 data-reactid="35"><a data-reactid="36">Billiamville</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="37"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="38"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="39"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="40"></div></section></div></div>

He’s performed in Vegas, Atlantic City, and headlined The Queens Theatre on London’s West End. He was a yearly staple at the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal and his material is entered in the Smithsonian Institute as examples of American humor during the 1980s. Don’t believe that? Take a LOOK. Billiam’s countless television appearances (Okay, not countless but many, many) include 2 Tonight Shows with Johnny Carson and, in no particular order, HBO, Showtime, Reno 911, and all those cable shows including Evening at the Improv,Caroline’s Comedy Hour, The A list, MTV's Half Hour Comedy Hour...
